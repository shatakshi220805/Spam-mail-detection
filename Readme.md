Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine-learning model to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam. It uses text preprocessing, feature extraction, and a classifier to detect unwanted messages.

Features
	•	Loads a dataset of email messages
	•	Cleans and preprocesses text
	•	Converts text into numerical vectors (TF-IDF)
	•	Trains a machine learning model
	•	Evaluates accuracy
	•	Predicts whether new messages are spam or not
	•	Fully implemented in a Google Colab Notebook
